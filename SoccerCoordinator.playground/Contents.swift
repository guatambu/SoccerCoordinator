    PLEASE NOTE:  
 
    all functions that print to console and generate the desired are commented out to start.
    i didn't want to inundate you while reviewing this.
 
    my code is not nearly as DRY as possible.  in fact that's where i got a bit stuck in this project in general.
    i know my code gets repetitive, but i couldn't see how to get at the data in these dictionaries in a more concise way.
    looking forward to any notes on this, though i suspect that if i were using more of an object oriented approach, perhaps this would be much simpler.  not sure of course.
    also, i gave more verbose names to the various data structures, variables, and constants because i like to err on the side of readability.  
    curious what your thoughts are on that, if you have the time and/or if you think it relevant to comment.
 
 
    Cheers and Thank You,
 
 
    Guatambu
 
 
    UPDATE NOTE (if you have time):  Thanks so much for your insightful comments.  a fella can't get be upset about not passing when it's constructuve like this.  so i am going to tackle your ideas at the bottom.
 
 
        one things i wanted to mention before diving in per your comment:
 
            *** "An alternate approach that can be used would be simply create two collections, one for experienced players, another for inexperienced players, and iterate through it to do the assignment. It is similar to yours but basically break it down into two steps."
 
        i was trying to make this an universal application.  in that, i was envisioning a parent with no programming abilities using this.  the scenario further being that say another 6 kids signed up with varying experience, and then that parent would have to include and sort the kids while avoiding accusations of playing favorites.  so, i was trying to make it "blind".
 
        i even thought about including a random generator for each player, experienced or not, so that the sorting would be totally independent of the parent generating the teams. but i wasn't sure if that was allowed since we didn't cover those tools like the 'random' and 'round'.  then using their random scores in addition to the experience to see who goes to what team.
 
        anyway, just some insight into what i was thinking about if that's of interest to you all.
 
        
        Cheers and Thanks again,
 
        Guatambu
 
 
        ps
        
        i am likely going to have to learn to curb my gamer tendencies which are to do everything a game/challenge/quest offers.  diminishing returns and all.  this challenge was fun all the same, even though i came up short, so thank you for the chance to try it out.  ;')

 EXTRA CREDIT
 
 
 Now let's take another crack at sorting for the height per reviewer's recommendations:
 
 *** "As for the height, one height, for the experienced/inexperienced collection, try sorting the first one by height in one order, and the the other one in opposite order. After that, you can simply pick the first player from each collection and assign them to the teams."

 UPDATE:  well, i am stuck on how to do this programatically. i can hardcode it by building the arrays myself, but i can't figure out how to get at the key value pairs of these dictionaries to then sort them in an array based on height.  i have searched the swift documentaiton, and maybe i can't find it because i don't know where to look.  in asking the internet it seems that this is something that requires more tools than we have learned thus far.
 
 Help?
 
 as an example, here is what i was trying to do with the problem i ran into (un-commenting it out gives the compiler error)...
 
 given array of dictionaries:
 

 
let myArray = [
    ["a": "1", "b": "3"],
    ["a": "2", "b": "4"]
 ]
 

myArray.sort {
    return $0 < $1
}
 
 print(myArray)

 /*
 
 this is me hardcoding it in from here on out for the extra credit.  i don't expect to get credit, because i can't efficiently scale this program.
 
 here are the arrays:
